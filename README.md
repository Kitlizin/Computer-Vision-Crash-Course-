Basic I/O Scripting (Images): Handles reading, displaying, saving, and modifying images using OpenCV.

Basic I/O Scripting (Videos): Processes video files and real-time streams, including reading, displaying, and saving frames.

Edge and Contour Detection: Detects object boundaries using techniques like Canny operator, useful for shape recognition.

Line and Circle Detection: Uses Hough Transform to detect geometric shapes, and object recognition.

Face Detection using OpenCV: Identifies faces through real-time stream using Haar cascades.

Performing Face Recognition: Recognizes and verifies individuals using Eigenface Recognition, Fisherface Recognition, and Local Binary Pattern Histograms (LBPH) Recognition.
