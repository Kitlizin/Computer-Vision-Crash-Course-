## Computer Vision Activity


In this activity, we explored Computer Vision by performing six key tasks using OpenCV:

 - Basic I/O Scripting (Images) 🖼️ – Read, display, save, and modify images.
 - Basic I/O Scripting (Videos) 🎥 – Process video files and real-time streams.
 - Edge and Contour Detection ✨ – Detect object boundaries using the Canny operator.
 - Line and Circle Detection 🔴 – Identify geometric shapes using the Hough Transform.
 - Face Detection 👤– Detect faces in real-time using Haar cascades.
 - Face Recognition 🤖 – Recognize individuals using Eigenface, Fisherface, and LBPH methods.

This hands-on experience deepened our understanding of image processing and real-time object recognition using OpenCV. 🚀
